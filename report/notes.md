## Sequences are extremely close to each other
At most 1 amino acid substitutions in PB1 & PA, 2 aas in NA & HA differentiate the 6
sequences. Note that these were sequenced from swine and not isolates.

## They are extremely close to circulating H3N2 strains in humans
All proteins are 99.5% id or closer to S15071, an isolate from Denmark same season.
Most proteins are 100% identitcal, only PB2 (99.74%), HA (99.47%), NS1 (99.57%), NA (99.78%)
differs between a representative of these new viruses and from S15071 at all.

## Mutations
In most proteins, one or a few of the sequences differ from circulating human strains.
Only the following two mutations are in most sequences AND also not in either S15071 or
A/Kansas/14/2017:
PB2 R508C
HA Q517H

These are also in all 6 sequences. After some googling, searching on Pubmed, use of FluSurver and looking in the book, I only found this:

PB2 R508C
Position: Near cap in cap-binding domain, but there is 1 residue between cap and this. 508C proejcts out towards the surface.

Mentioned in https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22389716/: 
    R508Q w. 3 other muts found to restore H5N1 PB2 activity when combined with seasonal strain
    Highly conserved position (99.7% by FluSurver). Close to cap-binding site.
    No nearby Cs for sulfide bridges

    Nearby mutation https://elifesciences.org/articles/45079 seems to increase activity
    in humans for an unknown mechanism (R355G in the paper)

HA Q517H
Mutation in cytoplasmic tail right at C'-end of H2. Not known in literature. Looks to be highly
perserved at least in the human sequences. It's preserved in the following of H3 segments:
      Q      H
Human 99.20% 0.66%
Avian 97.44% 2.24%
Swine 97.96% 1.48%

According to my downloaded sequences from GenBank.
So no strong association - probably rarer in humans because human flu is less diverse in general
